Neurax
======

Multidimensional reucrrent neural network to play Go.

Neurax can learn from played games. It support Smart Game Format storing. Comunication with GUI or server is realized by Go Text Protocol v2. Neural network has three layers (four with input layer). First hidden layer is multidimensional recurrent layer. Size of this layer is same as board size. Second hidden and output layer is standard layers with full conection of neurons between layers. As a learning method is implement Backpropagation with adaptiv dynamic.
